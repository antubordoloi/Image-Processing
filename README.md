# Image-Processing
Digital Image Processing using MATLAB

the images and perform the follwing:

(a) Perform median filtering (using 3×3, 5×5 mask) to remove the salt & pepper noise.
(b) Perform average filtering (using 3×3, 5×5 mask) to remove the noise.
(c) Perform high pass filtering.
(d) Perform high boost filtering.
