# Image-Processing for RGB image
Digital Image Processing using MATLAB

The program will Import colour images, add Gaussian, salt & pepper and speckle noise to
the images and perform the following operations:

(a) Perform median filtering (using 3×3, 5×5 mask) to remove the salt & pepper noise.
(b) Perform average filtering (using 3×3, 5×5 mask) to remove the noise.
(c) Perform high pass filtering.
(d) Perform high boost filtering.
